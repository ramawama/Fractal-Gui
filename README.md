# Fractal Gui
A fractal visualization tool of the Mandelbrot set!

## How 
1. Implemented an interactive interface using Qt GUI and Matplotlib to navigate and visualize the Mandelbrot set, allowing users to zoom into the fractal infinitely with different resolution inputs.
2. Utilized threading and multiprocessing to process image visualization tasks without locking or disrupting the GUI.
